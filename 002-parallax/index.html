      <h2>6th January, 1917</h2>
      
      <p>MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE! The first letter in the New Year falls on our most important anniversary and so it has to be a love letter. It is 8 years today, my treasure! And the two and a half years during which world- history has robbed me of the happiness of being allowed to live next to you, seem much longer than the sunny time when we were together. Little mouse, I don't wish to play the martyr, I can well imagine that during the time of our separation you have suffered a lot and still do, I also have a rather careless temperament inclined to forgetfulness, but I believe that you cannot have suffered as much as I did. You see, you live amidst dear relatives and, moreover, you can find consolation in being near the children. I have to yearn for all of you! And though my thoughts embark daily on the long journey to you as well, not always can my will keep them on the desired track, all too often they go astray on the way and questions about the future take hold of all my thinking.</p>

      <p>In order to compensate for all the sorrows of the past years, I have to provide for you and the children a future free from care. Presently I have in mind a big plan, which I will not discuss here because this is to be a love letter and not a business letter. Darling, if my plan were successful, then we shall stay in Bielitz; this is my new favorite idea. If you and the children have found a kind and gracious refuge there in these difficult times, then let us also be happy there in good times. It may be just 8 years since I told you that I want to be so happy with you that everybody will be green with envy. Do you agree, darling, that we were happy together and that we want to be even more so in the future? I am always reminded of the emotions, which bound me to you long ago, when I was in Chicago: adoring love and insatiable yearning for your presence.</p>

      <p>“I solemnly swear again that I consider as my permanent purpose in life to make you and our children happy.”</p>

      <p>My dearest, for me you still stand on a pedestal and I can only look up to you with a grateful heart; if, at least partly, I have become a decent human being, then it is only thanks to you - and I will never forget it. And the time of separation cannot diminish my adoration of you. In this respect I will not be older when I return to you; on the contrary, I will be rejuvenated. And today, on the eighth anniversary of our wedding day, 10000 kilometers far from you, I solemnly swear again that I consider as my permanent purpose in life to make you and our children happy. Here in my dear "Book of letters" you shall read, after a period of time the length of which I do not know, that it is you and only you who can give fulfillment to my life. May God's providence keep you healthy and give me strength to satisfy the purpose of me life.</p>

      <p>I have declared this day as an official holiday; I have cancelled all lessons and have been sitting all day near the stove (the temperature outside was -35) and dreaming. In the afternoon several friends came to visit me and there was soon an opportunity to talk about the children, so I could enthuse about you and the kids, and now I am happy, I am in a festive mood. I hope that next year we may celebrate this day together. We live here in some excitement, as there is a lot of talk about peace, in the last two weeks reports have been coming about peace- proposals. Although the prospects are still rather hazy, we hope and wait!</p>

      <p>With a thousand kisses.</p>
      
      <h2>2nd February, 1916</h2>
        
      <p>My love! The date will tell you that I am taking up my book for a special reason! What moves my heart today again I need not and I cannot describe here. My sweet, lovely Ederle! You cannot have any idea how I long for you! And when one of those dominant anniversaries comes up, then it always feels as if somebody were poking about with a wooden log in an open wound.</p>

      <p>What particularly affects me is that I am robbed of so much pleasure with my children. I really think of you always at all hours, but it is not that hot, vivid ferment anymore, the emotional life has been blunted by habit. Only from time to time does it flare up but then it is more intensive. This is how I feel today again, on a day when I feel to be so completely with you. Surely you will be thinking of me as well today, but you are definitely better off than I am because you can discuss what moves you with one another and you can count on mutual understanding of your problems. I, however, am left to my own resources and though I sometimes wear my heart on my sleeve - which is only human - I don't find any response, no understanding because everyone is full of his own grief and his own sorrows. Of what interest to him is my outpouring of emotions to which he listens with half an ear out of mere politeness. How could I touch his soul, even if I told him a hundred times what I am feeling.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, there are instants when I am happy not to talk to and listen to anybody because my heart is full of joy and sometimes of pain too. Then I close my eyes so as not to lose the tiniest part of what my inner eye shows me. Then I usually see myself among you, such as it was or as it will be, or how I wish that it soon should be. Then you all stand in front of me, so real, so tangible, that I feel I am perceiving your breath. Such moments are high points in my life. Unfortunately they do not come when I would wish but only when they choose to. And so time passes. Lost time which consumes more of your powers than if it was spent in the most demanding activity.</p>

      <p>I think I have changed. I am not what I used to be; I have become a grumbler, a crank and pessimist. I only hope that I will preserve at least a part of my temperament in this so difficult time. How long may it still last? This uncertainty is one of the worst torments we all suffer. A convicted criminal knows exactly when he will be free again. We do not know it and, after all the disappointments which we experienced with our personal estimates, nobody dares to voice even a guess how long the misery may last. The only consolation left for us is that one day the end must come. God give that this day be not far and that you all, for whom I pray and fear, will lie in my arms in good health and unscathed. That’s all for today. Fervent kisses to you all and especially to our dear birthday child!</p>
